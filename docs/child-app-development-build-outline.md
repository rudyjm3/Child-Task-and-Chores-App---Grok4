### Application Build Outline for Child Task and Chore App

Based on the feature outline in the uploaded document ("Child Task and Chore App Outline and Features doc.pdf"), I'll propose a structured build plan to develop the web app using HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. This outline breaks the project into sequential phases, starting with foundational elements and progressing to core features, advanced functionalities, and polish. Each phase will focus on a subset of features, allowing for incremental development, testing, and version control via GitHub commits.

The plan prioritizes:
- **Scalability and Maintainability**: Use modular code (e.g., separate PHP files for controllers, JS modules for UI logic), clear folder structures, and comments explaining purpose, inputs/outputs, and edge cases.
- **Design Principles**: Responsive design with CSS media queries for mobile/tablet/desktop. Modern, clean UI for parent dashboard (e.g., neutral colors, intuitive layouts). Kid-friendly for child views (bright, playful colors/icons, large tappable elements, minimal animations for autism sensitivity—toggleable where possible).
- **Testing**: After each phase, include manual tests (e.g., browser compatibility, form submissions) and suggest unit tests for critical JS/PHP functions as we go.
- **Versioning**: Start at Ver 1.0.0. Increment as follows:
  - Major (1.x.x): Complete a full section of features (e.g., authentication).
  - Minor (x.1.x): Add sub-features or refinements.
  - Bugfix (x.x.1): Fixes only.
- **Code Delivery**: For early phases with small files, I'll provide full files. As things grow, I'll specify exact insertion points (e.g., "Add this block after line 50 in index.php").
- **Overall Foresight**: Database schema will be designed upfront with extensibility (e.g., fields for future paid features like AI insights). Free vs. paid features will be gated via user subscription checks in PHP. Autism-friendly elements (e.g., toggleable sounds/animations, high-contrast modes) will be baked in from the start.
- **Tech Stack Setup Assumptions**: You'll need a local server like XAMPP/WAMP for PHP/MySQL. Host static files (HTML/CSS/JS) in a root folder. Use HTTPS in production for security.

#### Phase 1: Project Setup and Database Schema (Ver 1.0.0)
Focus: Establish the foundation without core logic yet. This ensures we have a scalable structure.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Create GitHub repo and initial commit.
  - Set up folder structure: 
    - `/` (root: index.php, login.php, etc.)
    - `/css/` (stylesheets, e.g., main.css for global, parent.css, child.css)
    - `/js/` (scripts, e.g., utils.js for shared functions)
    - `/includes/` (PHP helpers: db_connect.php, functions.php)
    - `/images/` (for icons/avatars)
    - `/uploads/` (for user-uploaded files, e.g., task photos; secure with .htaccess)
  - Design basic MySQL schema (from Section 12: Data Management):
    - Tables: users (parents/children), child_profiles, tasks, routines, rewards, points_logs, settings (for customizations), subscriptions (for monetization).
    - Include fields for all features (e.g., task table: id, title, description, points, timing_mode, image_url, audio_url*—* for paid).
  - Basic HTML skeleton: Landing page with login link, footer with version.
- **Output**: Full files for setup (e.g., db_connect.php with comments). Brief overview: This phase creates the app's backbone, connecting to DB and handling basic sessions.
- **Testing**: Verify DB connection, create sample tables.
- **Next**: Commit as Ver 1.0.0.

#### Phase 2: User Authentication and Account Management (Ver 1.1.0)
Focus: Implement Section 2. This is critical as it gates all other features.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Registration/login forms (PHP validation, hashed passwords).
  - Parent creates/manages child profiles (avatars, ages, preferences—store in DB).
  - Role-based access (parent admin, child limited).
  - Password recovery (PHP mailer).
  - Session management.
- **Design**: Simple, responsive forms. Kid profiles use colorful avatars.
- **Output**: Full files like register.php, login.php, profile.php. Overview: Handles secure user creation/login, with DB storage for profiles.
- **Testing**: Test logins, role checks, edge cases (invalid inputs).
- **Foresight**: Add subscription field to users table for future paid gates.

#### Phase 3: Dashboards (Ver 1.2.0)
Focus: Section 3. Basic UIs for parents and children.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Parent dashboard: Overview of children, links to create tasks/goals/rewards, simple charts (JS/CSS).
  - Child dashboard: Kid-friendly view with tasks list, points, large buttons/icons.
- **Design**: Parent: Modern grid layout. Child: Playful colors (e.g., blues/greens for calm), large fonts.
- **Output**: dashboard_parent.php, dashboard_child.php. Overview: Displays user-specific overviews, pulling from DB.
- **Testing**: Responsive on mobile/desktop, data display accuracy.

#### Phase 4: Task and Chore Management (Ver 2.0.0)
Focus: Sections 4.1-4.2. Core free feature.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Parent CRUD for tasks (forms with title, desc, points, recurrence, categories, timing modes).
  - Child views/marks complete (photo upload optional).
  - Approval workflow, search/filter.
  - Timers (JS countdowns), pause/resume, feedback pop-ups.
- **Design**: Icons/emojis for categories. Visual timers toggleable.
- **Output**: task.php and related files. Overview: Manages task lifecycle, with JS for interactive elements.
- **Testing**: Timer accuracy, DB updates on completion.

#### Phase 5: Routine Management (Ver 2.1.0)
Focus: Section 5. Builds on tasks.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Parent creates routines with grouped tasks, timeframes, dependencies.
  - Child starts routines, sequential timers, warnings*.
  - Bonus points, overtime tracking.
- **Design**: Collapsible cards for routines.
- **Output**: routine.php. Overview: Handles sequenced tasks with validation.
- **Testing**: Time validations, sequence flow.

#### Phase 6: Rewards System and Goal Setting (Ver 2.2.0)
Focus: Sections 6-7. Motivational elements (*paid for some).
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Rewards catalog, redemption.
  - Goals with trackers*.
  - Tiered rewards*.
- **Design**: Badge visuals for kids.
- **Output**: rewards.php, goals.php. Overview: Tracks points/rewards, with gates for paid.

#### Phase 7: Progress Tracking, Notifications, and Timers (Ver 3.0.0)
Focus: Sections 8-10.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Visualizations (charts, calendars).
  - In-app/email notifications.
  - Timer customizations*.
- **Design**: Minimal animations, accessible.
- **Output**: progress.php, notifications.php.

#### Phase 8: Customization, Accessibility, and Utilities (Ver 3.1.0)
Focus: Sections 11,13.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Themes, uploads*.
  - Help/feedback forms.
  - Offline fallback*.
- **Design**: ARIA labels, responsive.

#### Phase 9: Data Management, Security, and AI Insights (Ver 4.0.0)
Focus: Sections 12,14.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Exports*, security (validation, HTTPS).
  - AI integration* (e.g., call xAI API for insights).
- **Output**: Secure updates to existing files.

#### Phase 10: Monetization and Final Polish (Ver 4.1.0)
Focus: Section 15.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Subscription checks, ads for free tier.
  - App name (pick one, e.g., ChoreBuddy).
  - Full testing, deployment notes.

This outline aligns with the doc's sections, starting small to avoid overwhelm. We'll test iteratively, and I'll provide overviews per step.
